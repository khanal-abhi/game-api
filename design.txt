Starting the game design.

1. Plan the game. What I did in this step is to visualize the game. The game
 that I will be working on is Concentration. The game will have 20 cards, 10
  pairs or matching cards. Each card will be associated with a unique game
  and by tracking which cards have been matched based on their position and
  value, the game may progress. Each attempt a user makes will increment the
   attempts which is recorded for scoring purposes.

2. Design the game. Edited the models to reflect this. The endpoints
skeleton was already provided. Rather than re-invent the wheel, I edited the
 models such that each model and form conformed to my game instead of the
 default game.

 Game model and form contained a user, the number of attempts and whether or
  not the game was over.

 User model and form reflected a user, with a unique username and optional
 email that may be associated with multiple games.

 Card model and form reflected a Card, which belonged to a game. It has a
 value that is used to find a match and a position that reflects its
 position in the game as well a matched flag for sorting the matched cards
 against the unmatched ones.

 Score model and form that can be used to see the scores (the number of
 attempts needed to solve the game) as well as the date it was completed.

3. Test the game. Tested the game using the endpoints api explorer.
